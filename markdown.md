```
Three backticks will create a code box
It will stay that way until the system (or code) encounters another 3 backticks.
```

```
{
    My code goes here.
}
```

If you are typing in some info and you want to **bold** text, you would use two astericks

**This is how you bold multiple words** 

To _italicize_ something, you would put underscores on either side of what you are trying to italicize

To **_bold and italicize_** something, you would put double astericks and an underscore on either side of what you are trying to bold/italicize

If we want to bring attention to a single word and make it `code` you can use a single backtick around the word. (This is useful to bring in a command)

`whatever you type in between the backticks will become code`

To create a hyperlink in my markdown file: [tipper pic](https://consciouselectronic.com/2018/10/19/tipper-friends-announces-return-to-suwannee-with-three-night-full-moon-gathering/) you would put the words you want on the hyperlink in brackets immediately followed by the actual link surrounded by paranthesis with no spaces in between the brackets and the paranthesis

Insert the image itself, but no link to it:
